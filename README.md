# JUDSYS-1

*Current Status*: Just began.

JUDSYS-1 (**J**SON **U**nified **D**igital **S**ignature S**y**stem **S**tandard) is a standard meant to replace CMS/CAdES, XML-DSIG/XAdES, PAdES (PDF) and other digital signature systems.

This is mainly intended for Brazil, but it should be able to work for other countries with minimal or no changes.

Main points:

  * Full Unicode support for strings with an ASCII fallback. Examples:
    ```
    {"name": "Rep√∫blica Federativa do Brasil üáßüá∑", "name_ascii: "Republica Federativa do Brasil"}
    {"name": "‰∏≠Âçé‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂíåÂõΩ üá®üá≥", "name_ascii: "Zhong1hua2 Ren2min2 Gong4he2guo2"}
    ```
  * Full certification chain is always included (except for the root CAs).
  * Rules for dealing with illiterate people (no reading, computer illiterate or functionaly illiterate).
  * Simple and consistent JSON syntax with base64 to avoid canonicalization problems.
  * Minimal number of allowed algorithms in order to make implementations and interoperability easier.
  * Single document for all the rules. (timestamps, CA rules, hardware interaction, user interaction and naming conventions)
  * Single web API for timestamping. (just change the base URL)
  * Single web API for getting the public key for encrypting messages. (unified base URL)
  * Spearate key pairs for identifing the person and for signing documents.
  * Ease for users: Minimal options and variations to make digital signatures easy (or at least easier) to use.
    * Standard naming conventions.
    * Detached only signatures: this is for interoperability and to avoid unnecessary backups. (it also reduces the memory needed to parse the files)
    * Only two signature types: regular and timestamped.
    * Main document ids already in the certificate: CPF (Brazil SSN equivalent), RG/RNE (state issued ID).
    * Standard file extensions: `.y1c` for certificates, `.y1k` for private keys, `.y1s` for file signatures, `.y1e` for encrypted files, `.y1r` for revocation information, `.y1a` for attribute certificates.

Open questions:

  * Should quantum resistent algorithms be used?
  * Should `.par2` be automatically generated?
  * Should the expression "digital signature" or "cryptographic signature" be used?
  * Which government ids be included on the certificate instead of on a revocation certificate? CPF and RG/RNE only? What about: NIT (empoyee identification number), T√≠tulo de Eleitor (voter's card), CNH (driver's license)?
  * Should a picture of the user be included in the certificate?
  * How to deal with social names and nicknames?
  * Should people's personal certificates be separated from those used in their jobs?
    * Example: should a judge have a single certificate and an attribute certificate or should they have two separate certificates? 
    * The first one is cheaper, as people won't have to pay for two separate certificates, but the second one is easier to implement.
  * Who can issue attribute certificates?
    * I think that allowing anyone to issue them can makes things easier, as it can easily work as "procura√ß√£o" (a document syaing that someone else is allowed to do certain specified things in your name).

Algortithm candidates:

  * Hashing: [SHA3-512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3)
  * Encryptions and signing: [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) with a minimum of 4096 bits (better safe than sorry :)
  * Key derivation from passwords: [Argon2id](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2)
