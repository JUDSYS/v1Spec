1.  Introduction

   Currently, ITI, the government body responsible of ICP-Brasil,
   Brazil's PKI (Public Key Infrastructure), endorses three different
   standards: CAdES, XAdES and PAdES.

   Since they are all based on X.509 which is used in SSL, there should
   be an abundance of good software libraries and end user applications
   to support at least one of these standard.

   This is not the case.  While there have been some efforts to write
   open source libraries and end user applications for ICP-Brasil, they
   are hard to find and most seem unfinished and abandoned.

   ITI provides a digital signature verification web tool, but it is
   only for CAdES and doesn't seem to work well.

   PAdES is a monster of its own kind.  In an attempt to replicate the
   paper experience in the digital world, a PDF file can be signed,
   edited and resigned by another person in a way that they signed over
   different version of the same document.  This is both hard to
   implement and hard to explain to end users.

   To make matters worse, PDF readers almost never come with the
   necessary CAs to verify ICP-Brasil digital signatures.

   Perhaps as result of this mess of different standards, the ITI admits
   that, no one is obliged to accept digital signatures in Brazil:

      In face of the authenticity generated by the usage of ICP-Brasil
      digital certificates, is it correct to assert that everyone
      (government bodies, banks, private citizens, etc.) *must* accept
      them?
      .
      The answer is negative.  As noted, ICP-Brasil confers legal
      validity to electronic manifestations.  However, no entity nor
      government body nor private agent is required by law to accept
      digitally signed electronic documents.
      .
      And this is for a simple reason: even though we live in an
      information society, many entities, both public and private, do
      not yet find themselves adherent to this new technological
      paradigm.  They may even simply lack the necessary equipments to
      receive, verify and store digitally signed documents.

   This situation is unacceptable.  We need a digital signature standard
   that:

   1.  Is easy for programmers to implement.  Including reference
       libraries in multiple languages.

   2.  Is easy for ordinary people to use on a day to day basis.

   3.  Has strict rules to avoid interoperability problems.

   4.  Has mandatory acceptance by law.

   This document aims to provide a digital signature standard that
   address points one through three.  Hopefully, this standard may
   fulfil the fourth point in the near future.

1.1.  Right of Implementation

   Any person, group or organization can freely implement this standard
   so long as the implementation is complete.

1.2.  Terminology

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   All apps MUST use the standard translations present in this document
   when they present in the Language specific rules section.

   *User*: A human being using a JUDSYS app.  Unless otherwise
   specified, users MUST ALWAYS be considered as non-tech-savvy people.

   *Signing app*: A computer program that digitally signs documents
   according to this standard.

   *Verifier app*: A computer program that verifies a digital signature
   according to this standard.

   (*App*) *JUDSYS app*: A computer program that is either a singing app
   or a verifier app or both.

   *Subject qualifiers*: Certain values that qualify the subject.  Ex:
   email, full name, government issued identification numbers, et
   cetera.

   *Natrual person*: A human beign.

   *Legal person*: A group of people who the Law considers to be its own
   person.

   *Digital signature*:

   (*PKI*) *Public Key Infrastructure*:

   (*KP*) *Key Pair*:

   *Certificate*: A short signed message that states a key pair is in
   the control of a specific subject.

   (*CA*) *Certificate Authority*: A certificate that is allowed to sign
   other certificates.  This is, a CA is an entity (usually a company or
   government body) that ensures that the subject on a certificate is
   really the person it names.

   (*PA*) *Proof of attribute*: A short signed message in which the
   issuer certifies that a certain attribute is true.  Examples: job
   titles and permissions delegated by the issuer to the subject.

   (*TA*) *Timestamping Authority*

   This is very similar to the concept of attribute certificates.  The
   names was changed to avoid using the "certificate" in two different
   contexts that may confuse users.

   *ICAO*: International Civil Aviation Organization.

   *JSON*: Javascript Object Notation.

2.  Encoding

2.1.  Files

   All JUDSYS-1 files are JSON encoded with UTF-8.

   To avoid canonicalization problems, all signed messages are encoded
   in base64.

   Example:

Internet-Draft                   JUDSYS1                     August 2018


   {"b": 1, "a":2}
   // becomes
   {
       "raw": "eyJiIjogMSwgImEiOjJ9Cg==",
       // This is to aid humans debugging, not for machines to use
       "what": "JUDSYS-1 base64"
   }

2.1.1.  File extensions

   All JUDSYS-1 extensions begin with ".j1" (dot, jay, one).

   For JUDSYS-1 files, all apps MUST use only the file extensions show
   below:

            +-----------+------------------------------------+
            | Extension | Usage                              |
            +-----------+------------------------------------+
            | ".j1c"    | Certificates (no private keys)     |
            | ".j1a"    | Attribute certificates             |
            | ".j1k"    | Certificates with the private keys |
            | ".j1s"    | Detached digital signature         |
            | ".j1e"    | Encrypted file                     |
            | ".j1r"    | Revocation information             |
            +-----------+------------------------------------+

2.2.  Strings

   All apps MUST have proper Unicode support and fonts to display any
   characters that may be necessary for the country of intended use.
   This is, an app for France MUST have fonts with accented characters,
   but SHOULD NOT have any CJK nor Cyrillic support.  An app for Russia
   MUST have Cyrillic and Latin support, but SHOULD NOT have CJK or
   Mongolian support.

   It is RECOMMENDED to store string in NFC (Normal Form Composition).

   It is RECOMMENDED that all apps support as much Unicode characters
   and scripts as possible.  It is also RECOMMENDED that all apps
   include the necessary fonts.

   Emoji usage is discouraged.

2.3.  Dates

   All dates MUST be encoded as strings according to the [RFC3339].

   If the time is not available, it MUST be assumed to be midnight.

Internet-Draft                   JUDSYS1                     August 2018


   Times MUST NOT include fractions of a second.

2.4.  Country codes

   All countries or similar MUST be represented by the upper case two
   letter codes defined on ISO 3166-1.  If a country or similar does not
   have such code, it MUST be full English name with spaces and proper
   capitalization.  Ex: "Principality of Sealand" not "principality of
   sealand" nor "PrincipalityOf_Sealand".

   International organizations MUST use their upper case English acronym
   if it has more than two letters.  Ex: "ICAO" and "ICJ".  Otherwise
   the full English name with spaces and capitalization MUST be used.
   Ex: "League of Nations".

   Special cases are:

   1.  "UN" for the United Nations (already on the ISO 3166-1).

   2.  "EU" for the European Union (already on the ISO 3166-1).

   3.  "INT" for international things such as passports, names and date
       of birth.

   4.  "MERCOSU" for the Southern Common Market, Mercosur in Spanish and
       Mercosul in Portuguese.

   5.  "UNASU" for the Union of South American Nations, UNSAUR in
       Spanish and UNASUL in Portuguese.

   6.  "NAFTA" for the North American Free Trade Agreement.

   7.  "HOAX" for URSAL - Uniao das Republicas Socialistas da America
       Latina.

2.5.  Certificate chains

   All JUDSYS-1 files MUST include all the necessary certificates,
   attribute certificates and revocation files for verifying the file in
   question.

   An exception is made to the root CAs which MUST NOT be included in
   any JUDSYS-1 file, as they MUST be a part of the apps themselves,
   preferably in the app's source code.

3.  Certificates

   &#9999;&#65039;

3.1.  Keys

   All keys are encoded as a dictionaries, which MUST have the following
   keys:

   1.  "algorithm"

   2.  "id": A hash of the key that uniquely identifies it.

   3.  "usage": A dictionary that indicates what the key may be used
       for.  Possible keys:

       1.  "signing": The key MAY be used to sign digital documents,
           issue and revoke attribute certificates.

       2.  "identification": They key MAY be used to identify the
           subject.

       3.  "encryption": The key MAY be used for everyone to encrypt
           messages to the subject.

       4.  "certification": The key MAY be used to issue digital
           certificates.

       5.  "revocation": They key MAY be used to issue certificate
           revocations.

   Each key MUST NOT be used in any algorithms other than the one
   prescribed on the key "algorithm".

3.2.  Subject Attributes

   Attributes in the singular are a single value and attributes in the
   plural are arrays.

   The CA MUST verify the attributes it will use on certificates it
   issues.  If any verification is not done or fails, the corresponding
   attributes MUST NOT be included in the issued certificate.  Examples:

   1.  If the CA fails to verify that a phone number really belongs to
       the subject, it MUST never be included.

   2.  If the subject of the certificate to be issued forgets to bring
       their US/SSN, this attribute MUST NOT be included in the
       certificate.

   If a CA MAY refuse to issue a certificate if essential properties
   could not verified.  Examples: INT/name, US/SSN, BR/RG, BR/CPF.

3.2.1.  INT/type

   An enum describing the type of the subject.  Possible values are:
   "natural person", "legal person", "authority" (certificate authority
   and time-stamping authorities) and "other" (ex: software).

3.2.2.  INT/name

   Each name is a one line Unicode string.

   All name entries each MUST be at most 5 KiB long.

   All apps MUST support such long names.  They MAY, however, show only
   the beginning of the name by default and have a simple way to show
   the full name.  Example: a tooltip or a button close to the name.

   There MUST be at least one name in the "INT/name" attribute.

   Any prefixes, suffixes, infixes, honorifics and similar things
   attached to the name MUST be verified.  Example: a person may never
   use the prefix "Dr." if they have no valid doctorates degree.

   Generic prefixes like "Mr." or "Ms." and job titles MUST NOT be
   included in any of the names.

   For legal persons, it is recommended to follow the convention:
   "(<Acronym>) <Full Legal Name> <Any special endings>" Examples:

   1.  (USP) Universidade Sao Paulo

   2.  Monsters Inc.

   3.  Empresa Qualquer Servicos e Comercio LTDA

   For natural persons, it is recommended to follow the convention:
   "(<Nick Name>) <First Name> <Full Middle Name> <Last Name>" Examples:

   1.  Dennis MacAlister Ritchie

   2.  (FHC) Fernando Henrique Cardoso

   3.  (Dom Pedro II) Pedro de Alcantara Joao Carlos Leopoldo Salvador
       Bibiano Francisco Xavier de Paula Leocadio Miguel Gabriel Rafael
       Gonzaga

3.2.3.  INT/parents

3.2.4.  INT/emails

   An array of the subject's email addresses.

   The fist entry is considered the main one.

   The subject MAY have no email address.

   It is RECOMENDED to have at least one ASCII email address.

   Examples:

   // Okay:
   []
   ["someone@example.com"]
   ["jose@construcoes-ltda.br", "jose@construcoes-ltda.br"]
   ["jose@construcoes-ltda.br", "jose@xn--construes-ltda-mjb8t.br"]
   ["jose@construcoes-ltda.br", "jose@construcoes-ltda.br",
    "jose@xn--construes-ltda-mjb8t.br"]
   ["jose@construcoes-ltda.br"]
   ["jose@construcoes-ltda.br", "jose@construcoes-ltda.br"]

3.2.5.  INT/phones

   For SPAM/robo-calling prevention the subject MUST have the right to
   refuse the inclusion of the "INT/phone" attribute.

   The phone numbers MUST be encoded as a string array.  Each element of
   that array represents one phone number and MUST include the country
   and area codes.

   The country code part MUST begin with a "+" (plus sign) and have a
   space to separate it from the rest of the number.  This is mainly to
   aid humans, by separating the international part from the local one.

   The rest of the number SHOULD follow the traditions and conventions
   of the country in question and MAY include punctuation.

   Examples:

   // Okay:

   ["+55 (11) 0 0000-0000", "+55 0800 000"]
   // Wrong:
   ["+55(11) 0 0000-0000", "+550800000", "55 0800 000"]

   Note: This attribute is intended to be used by some legal persons and
   by pretty much no natural persons.

3.2.6.  INT/addresses

   For security reasons the subject MUST have the right to refuse the
   inclusion of "INT/address" attribute.

3.2.7.  INT/pictures

   For privacy reasons the subject SHOULD have the right to refuse the
   inclusion of "INT/picture" attribute.  The CA, however, CAN require
   this attribute but its is encouraged not to require it.

   The picture MUST always be static: no animated GIFs or similar.

   For natural persons the image MUST be picture of the subject.  The
   specific are left to the CA, but it SHOULD follow the traditions and
   conventions of the CA's country.

   One suggestion for CAs is to follow the ICAO guidlines on photos for
   passports.

   For legal persons the image MUST be a logo or other symbol that
   represents the subject.  It MUST NOT be a picture of the owners or of
   the place where the subject is.  Again, specific are left to the CA.

   Support for this property in apps is OPTIONAL but RECOMENDED to those
   that have a GUI.

   Those that decide to implement this property MUST be able do decode
   JPEG and PNG.

   The picture MUST be data URL encoded using base64 and MUST NOT exceed
   1 MiB.  The size restriction applies to the image itself, not to the
   string that encodes it.

   Example: (Tux, the Linux mascot)

["data:image/jpeg;base64,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"]

3.2.8.  INT/passports

   Each passport (see [ICAO-9303]) is encoded as a dictionary with the
   following keys:

   1.   "type": Indicates the type of document, for passports this is a
        "P".

   2.   "number": A string, which MAY contain letters, the identifies
        this passport.

   3.   "country": The country that issued the passport.

   4.   "surname": The subject's last name.

   5.   "given_name": The subject's first name.

   6.   "nationality": The subject's nationality.

   7.   "date_of_birth": The subject's date of birth.

   8.   "place_of_birth": The subject's place of birth.

   9.   "personal_number": An id number identifying the subject.

   10.  "sex": The sex or gender of the subject.  Note that "X" and
        other characters may be used instead of the traditional "F" and
        "M".

   11.  "date_of_issue": The date in which the passport was issued.

   12.  "date_of_expiry": The date in which the passport will expire.

   13.  "MRZ": the contents on the MRZ (machine readable zone).

   Only "type", "country" and "number" *MUST BE* present.

   The "given_name" and "surname" are OPTIONAL because some people may
   have no first or last name.  However, at least one of them MUST be
   included.

   Except of dates, it is RECOMMENDED that all fields match the way they
   are presented on the VIZ (Visual Inspection Zone), rather than the
   MRZ.

4.  Certification Chain

   &#128073; Open Question: Should software receive certificates?  Ex:
   Should a bank have a specific certificate only for its web server
   that is used not for SSL but for singing that it approved clients
   requests (loans for instance) and singing bank statements?

4.1.  Public Key Infrastructure

4.2.  Nameless Certificates

   &#128073; Open Question: It is feature a good idea?

   Nameless certificates are self signed certificates meant for the end
   user.  They are intended to serve as a way for people to start using
   and testing JUDSYS-1 without the need to pay the CAs.

   All nameless certificates MUST have, on both "subject" and "issuer",
   the "INT/name" attribute with a single element "Nameless
   Certificate".  There MUST NOT be any other names.

   The choice to prohibit names is intentional, as it ensures that no
   app will be able to display an unverified name, thus forcing the user
   to keep an "address book" to associate each person to their
   certificate.

6.  Signatures

6.1.  Standard attributes

   All signature attributes MUST NOT be arrays.

   The "INT/date" and "INT/reason" attributes are MANDATORY.  All others
   are OPTIONAL, but each country MAY require certain attributes.

6.1.1.  INT/reason

   A dictionary that indicates why the signer is signing this document.
   Possible keys:

   1.  "sent": The signer sent the document.

   2.  "created": The signer created the document.

   3.  "approved": The signer approved or accepted the document (this is
       the most common type signature).

   4.  "rejected": The signer rejected the document.

   5.  "delivered": The signer placed the document where the recipient
       is expected to look regularly.  Example: A server placed an email
       on the recipient's account.

   6.  "received": The signer received the document.  Example: a person
       counter-signs with this key to confirm they received an email.

   7.  "timestamp": The signer testifies that the document existed at
       that moment in time.

   8.  "witness": The signer testifies they saw the previous signings
       occur at the said time and without coercion.

   9.  "authentic-scan": The signer testifies that the file being signed
       is an authentic copy/scan of the original physical document.

   All undefined values MUST be interpreted as false.

   Apps MUST NOT add their own keys.

   Both the *approved* and *rejected* keys MAY be true at the same time.
   When this happens, it means that the signer approved a part of the
   document and rejected another.  The user MUST be informed when this
   happens.

   "lat" and "lon" are mainly intended to automatically show markers on
   maps for the end user.

6.1.3.  INT/date

   A string with the time in which the signer claims to have signed the
   document.

   All apps MUST warn the user that this value is just a claim which may

   If a signing app cannot verify the file for dynamic content and it is
   not on the white list, it MUST warn the user about the possibility of
   dynamic content.

   For PDF, the verification MUST check for, and fail to find all of the
   following:

   1.  Any signs of JavaScript.

   For HTML, the verification MUST check for, and fail to find all of
   the following:

   1.  The "<script>" tag.

   2.  Properties such as "onclick" and "oninput" on any tags.

   3.  External URLs for the tags "<link>" and "<style>".  Note that
       links, "<a>" tag, are fine regardless of the URL they point to
       and the "<script>" tag will fail the verification independently
       of the URL.

   For Office Open XML (MOX), Open Document Format for Office
   Applications (ODF) and older Microsoft Office files, the verification
   MUST check for, and fail to find all of the following:

   1.  OLE content.

   2.  (&#9999;&#65039; what else?)

   All signing apps CAN assume that the following file formats have no
   dynamic content:

   1.  Image files, including JPEG (".jpg" and ".jpeg"), PNG (".png"),
       GIF (".gif"), BMP (".bmp") and TIFF (".tiff" and ".tif").

   2.  Text files, including pure text (".txt") and rich text (".rtf").

   3.  Markdown files (".md").

   4.  TeX files (".tex").

   5.  XML files (".xml").

   All signing apps MUST check extension in a case insensitive manner.

11.  Country Specific Rules

11.1.  Brazil

   All certificates issued for natural persons MUST have the following
   attributes:

   1.  "BR/CPF"

   2.  "BR/RG" or "BR/RNE" or "INT/passport": The certificate MAY have
       any combination of them so long as there is at least one.

   For legal persons, the "INT/name" attribute MUST be the full "razao
   social".

   Even if official documents show a name in all caps, all names MUST
   have propper capitalization.  Ex: "Pedro de Alantara", not "PEDRO DE
   ALCANTARA" nor "Pedro De Alcantara".

   All certificates issued for legal persons MUST have the following
   attributes:

   1.  "BR/CNPJ"

   For legal persons, they SHOULD also have, when possible:

   1.  "BR/IE" (inscricao estadual)

   2.  "BR/IM" (inscricao municipal)

   3.  "BR/NIRE" (junta comercial)

11.2.  Subject Attributes

11.2.1.  BR/CPF

   CPF (_Cadastro de Pessoas Fisicas_) number.  This MUST be encoded as
   a trimmed string with the format: "999.999.999/99".

   "BR/CPF" MUST NOT be encoded as an array.

   Example: "001.456.789/00"

   All apps MUST NOT reject a BR/CPF entry because the verification
   digits (the last two) are incorrect.

11.2.2.  BR/CNPJ

   CNPJ (_Cadastro Nacional de Pessoas Juridicas_) number.  This MUST be
   encoded as a trimmed string with the format: "99.999.999/9999-99".

   "BR/CNPJ" MUST NOT be encoded as an array.

   Example: "01.012.123/0001-99"

   All apps MUST NOT reject a "BR/CNPJ" entry because the verification
   digits (the last two) are incorrect.

11.2.3.  BR/RNE

   RNE (_Registro Nacional de Estrangeiros_) MUST be encoded as a string
   with all punctuation.

   Example: &#9999;&#65039;

11.2.4.  BR/RG

   RG (_Registro Geral_) MUST be encoded as an array of dictionaries
   with the keys:

   1.  "number" for the RG number which MUST include punctuation.

   2.  "digit" for the verification digit, i.e. the character after the
       hyphen.  If the subject RG has no digit this string MUST be
       empty.

   3.  "state" the two letter uppercase code for the federative unit
       that issued the document.

   4.  "issuer" the institution that actually issued the RG.

   5.  "short_form" a concise string expressing the main things about
       the RG.  The following algorithm MUST be used:

   IF digit IS present THEN
       short_form = number + "-" + digit + " /" + state
   ELSE
       short_form = number + " /" + state
   END IF

   Example of an RG:

   {
       // Number with punctuation
       "number": "12.345.678",
       // The character after the hyphen when present
       "digit": "X",
       // The issuing state (two letter upper case code)
       "state": "DF",
       // Issuing organization ("orgao emissor") with diacritics
       "issuer": "Secretaria de Seguranca Publica",
       // number + " " + state (if digit == "")
       // number + "-" + digit + " " + state (if digit == "")
       "short_form": "12.345.678-X DF"
