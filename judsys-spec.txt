1.  Introduction

   Currently, ITI, the government body responsible of ICP-Brasil,
   Brazil's PKI (Public Key Infrastructure), endorses three different
   standards: CAdES, XAdES and PAdES.

   Since they are all based on X.509 which is used in SSL, there should
   be an abundance of good software libraries and end user applications
   to support at least one of these standard.

   This is not the case.  While there have been some efforts to write
   open source libraries and end user applications for ICP-Brasil, they
   are hard to find and most seem unfinished and abandoned.

   ITI provides a digital signature verification web tool, but it is
   only for CAdES and doesn't seem to work well.

   PAdES is a monster of its own kind.  In an attempt to replicate the
   paper experience in the digital world, a PDF file can be signed,
   edited and resigned by another person in a way that they signed over
   different version of the same document.  This is both hard to
   implement and hard to explain to end users.

   To make matters worse, PDF readers almost never come with the
   necessary CAs to verify ICP-Brasil digital signatures.

   Perhaps as result of this mess of different standards, the ITI admits
   that, no one is obliged to accept digital signatures in Brazil:

      In face of the authenticity generated by the usage of ICP-Brasil
      digital certificates, is it correct to assert that everyone
      (government bodies, banks, private citizens, etc.) must accept
      them?
      .
      The answer is negative.  As noted, ICP-Brasil confers legal
      validity to electronic manifestations.  However, no entity nor
      government body nor private agent is required by law to accept
      digitally signed electronic documents.

      .
      And this is for a simple reason: even though we live in an
      information society, many entities, both public and private, do
      not yet find themselves adherent to this new technological
      paradigm.  They may even simply lack the necessary equipments to
      receive, verify and store digitally signed documents.

      frequentes/567-questoes-juridicas#r21 [1] (in Portuguese), ITI -
      Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia da Informacao

   This situation is unacceptable.  We need a digital signature standard
   that:

   1.  Is easy for programmers to implement.  Including reference
       libraries in multiple languages.

   2.  Is easy for ordinary people to use on a day to day basis.

   3.  Has strict rules to avoid interoperability problems.

   4.  Has mandatory acceptance by law.

   This document aims to provide a digital signature standard that
   address points one through three.  Hopefully, this standard may
   fulfil the fourth point in the near future.

1.1.  Terminology

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   All apps MUST use the standard translations present in this document
   when they present in the Language specific rules section.

   *User*: A human being using a JUDSYS app.  Unless otherwise
   specified, users MUST ALWAYS be considered as non-tech-savvy people.

   *Signing app*: A computer program that digitally signs documents
   according to this standard.

   *Verifier app*: A computer program that verifies a digital signature
   according to this standard.

   (*App*) *JUDSYS app*: A computer program that is either a singing app
   or a verifier app or both.

   *Subject qualifiers*: Certain values that qualify the subject.  Ex:
   email, full name, government issued identification numbers, et
   cetera.

   *Natrual person*: A human beign.

   *Legal person*: A group of people who the Law considers to be its own
   person.

   *Digital signature*:

   (*PKI*) *Public Key Infrastructure*:

   (*KP*) *Key Pair*:

   *Certificate*: A short signed message that states a key pair is in
   the control of a specific subject.

   (*CA*) *Certificate Authority*: A certificate that is allowed to sign
   other certificates.  This is, a CA is an entity (usually a company or
   government body) that ensures that the subject on a certificate is
   really the person it names.

   (*PA*) *Proof of attribute*: A short signed message in which the
   issuer certifies that a certain attribute is true.  Examples: job
   titles and permissions delegated by the issuer to the subject.

   (*TA*) *Timestamping Authority*

   This is very similar to the concept of attribute certificates.  The
   names was changed to avoid using the "certificate" in two different
   contexts that may confuse users.

   *ICAO*: _International Civil Aviation Organization_.

   *JSON*: _Javascript Object Notation_.

2.  Security Considerations

   Correct functioning of security mechanisms depend critically on the
   evil bit being set properly.  If faulty components do not set the
   evil bit to 1 when appropriate, firewalls will not be able to do
   their jobs properly.  Similarly, if the bit is set to 1 when it
   shouldn't be, a denial of service condition may occur.
