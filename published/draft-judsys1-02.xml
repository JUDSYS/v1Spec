<abstract>
<t>A simple digital signature standard designed to be used by regular people and to be of mandatory acceptance and to replace PAdES, XAdES and CAdES.</t>
</abstract>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>Currently, ITI, the government body responsible of ICP-Brasil, Brazil's PKI (Public Key Infrastructure), endorses three different standards: CAdES, XAdES and PAdES.</t>
<t>Since they are all based on X.509 which is used in SSL, there should be an abundance of good software libraries and end user applications to support at least one of these standard.</t>
<t>This is not the case. While there have been some efforts to write open source libraries and end user applications for ICP-Brasil, they are hard to find and most seem unfinished and abandoned.</t>
<t>ITI provides a digital signature verification web tool, but it is only for CAdES and doesn't seem to work well.</t>
<t>PAdES is a monster of its own kind. In an attempt to replicate the paper experience in the digital world, a PDF file can be signed, edited and resigned by another person in a way that they signed over different version of the same document. This is both hard to implement and hard to explain to end users.</t>
<t>To make matters worse, PDF readers almost never come with the necessary CAs to verify ICP-Brasil digital signatures.</t>
<t>Perhaps as result of this mess of different standards, the ITI admits that, no one is obliged to accept digital signatures in Brazil (see <xref target="ITI-FAQ-21"></xref>).</t>
<t>This situation is unacceptable. We need a digital signature standard that:</t>
<t>
<list style="numbers">
<t>Is easy for programmers to implement. Including reference libraries in multiple languages.</t>
<t>Is easy for ordinary people to use on a day to day basis.</t>
<t>Has strict rules to avoid interoperability problems.</t>
<t>Has mandatory acceptance by law.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>This document aims to provide a digital signature standard that address points one through three. Hopefully, this standard may fulfil the fourth point in the near future.</t>

<section anchor="right-of-implementation" title="Right of Implementation">
<t>Any person, group or organization can freely implement this standard so long as the implementation is complete.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
<t>The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
document, are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
<t>All apps MUST use the standard translations present in this document when they present in the Language specific rules section.</t>
<t><spanx style="strong">User</spanx>: A human being using a JUDSYS app. Unless otherwise specified, users MUST always be considered as non-tech-savvy people.</t>
<t><spanx style="strong">Signing app</spanx>: A computer program that digitally signs documents according to this standard.</t>
<t><spanx style="strong">Verifier app</spanx>: A computer program that verifies a digital signature according to this standard.</t>
<t>(<spanx style="strong">App</spanx>) <spanx style="strong">JUDSYS app</spanx> or <spanx style="strong">implementation</spanx>: A computer program that is either a singing app or a verifier app or both.</t>
<t><spanx style="strong">Subject attributes</spanx>: Certain values that qualify the subject. Ex: email, full name, government issued identification numbers, et cetera.</t>
<t><spanx style="strong">Natural person</spanx>: A human begin.</t>
<t><spanx style="strong">Legal person</spanx>: A group of people who the Law considers to be its own person.</t>
<t><spanx style="strong">Software person</spanx>: A piece of software that acts in the name of a natural or legal person.</t>
<t><spanx style="strong">Digital signature</spanx>:</t>
<t>(<spanx style="strong">PKI</spanx>) <spanx style="strong">Public Key Infrastructure</spanx>:</t>
<t>(<spanx style="strong">KP</spanx>) <spanx style="strong">Key Pair</spanx>:</t>
<t><spanx style="strong">Certificate</spanx>: A short signed message that states a key pair is in the control of a specific subject.</t>
<t>(<spanx style="strong">CA</spanx>) <spanx style="strong">Certificate Authority</spanx>: A certificate that is allowed to sign other certificates. This is, a CA is an entity (usually a company or government body) that ensures that the subject on a certificate is really the person it names.</t>
<t>(<spanx style="strong">PA</spanx>) <spanx style="strong">Proof of attribute</spanx>: A short signed message in which the issuer certifies that a certain attribute is true. Examples: job titles and permissions delegated by the issuer to the subject.</t>
<t>(<spanx style="strong">TA</spanx>) <spanx style="strong">Time-stamping Authority</spanx></t>
<t>This is very similar to the concept of attribute certificates. The names was changed to avoid using the &quot;certificate&quot; in two different contexts that may confuse users.</t>
<t><spanx style="strong">ICAO</spanx>: International Civil Aviation Organization.</t>
<t><spanx style="strong">JSON</spanx>: JavaScript Object Notation.</t>

<section anchor="encoding" title="Encoding">

<section anchor="files" title="Files">
<t>All JUDSYS-1 files are JSON encoded with UTF-8.</t>
<t>To avoid canonicalization problems, all signed messages are encoded in base64.</t>
<t>Example:</t>

<figure><artwork type="js">{&quot;b&quot;: 1, &quot;a&quot;:2}
// becomes
{
    &quot;raw&quot;: &quot;eyJiIjogMSwgImEiOjJ9Cg==&quot;,

    &quot;what&quot;: &quot;JUDSYS-1 base64&quot;
}
</artwork></figure>

<section anchor="file-extensions" title="File extensions">
<t>All JUDSYS-1 extensions begin with <spanx style="verb">.j1</spanx> (dot, jay, one).</t>
<t>For JUDSYS-1 files, all apps MUST use only the file extensions show below:</t>

<section anchor="strings" title="Strings">
<t>All apps MUST have proper Unicode support and fonts to display any characters that may be necessary for the country of intended use. This is, an app for France MUST have fonts with accented characters, but MAY have no CJK nor Cyrillic support. An app for Russia MUST have Cyrillic and Latin support, but MAY have no CJK or Mongolian support.</t>
<t>It is RECOMMENDED to store string in NFC (Normal Form Composition).</t>
<t>It is RECOMMENDED that all apps support as much Unicode characters and scripts as possible. It is also RECOMMENDED that all apps include the necessary fonts.</t>
<t>Emoji usage is discouraged.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="dates" title="Dates">
<t>All dates MUST be encoded as strings according to the <xref target="RFC3339"></xref>.</t>
<t>If the time is not available, it MUST be assumed to be midnight.</t>
<t>Times MUST NOT include fractions of a second.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="country-like-codes" title="Country-like codes">
<t>In this spec, country-like means any sovereign state, international organization or similar. For example, the United Nations, the European Union, the UK and the International Court of Justice are country-like but England and Wales are not.</t>
<t>All countries-like MUST be represented by the upper case three letter codes defined on ISO 3166-1 alpha-3. If a country-like does not have such code, it MUST be full English name with spaces and proper capitalization. Ex: <spanx style="verb">Principality of Sealand</spanx> not <spanx style="verb">principality of sealand</spanx> nor <spanx style="verb">PrincipalityOf_Sealand</spanx>.</t>
<t>International organizations MUST use their upper case English acronym and their full English name separated by a hyphen with spaces on both sides. Ex: <spanx style="verb">ICAO - International Civil Aviation Organization</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">ICJ - International Court of Justice</spanx>.</t>
<t>Special cases are:</t>
<t>
<list style="numbers">
<t><spanx style="verb">UN</spanx> for the United Nations (already on the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2).</t>
<t><spanx style="verb">EU</spanx> for the European Union (already on the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2).</t>

</section>

<section anchor="certificate-chains" title="Certificate chains">
<t>All JUDSYS-1 certification chains are simple trees with root CAs at the top.  Cross-signing or other complicated methods MUST NOT be used.</t>
<t>All JUDSYS-1 files MUST include exactly all the necessary certificates, attribute certificates and revocation files for verifying the file in question.</t>
<t>An exception is made to the root CAs which MUST NOT be included in any JUDSYS-1 file, as they MUST be a part of the apps themselves, preferably in the implementation source code.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="certificates" title="Certificates">
<t>A certificate is a signed message in which the issuer certifies that the subject has those keys.</t>
<t>A certificate is an object with the following keys:</t>

<t>All keys are encoded as a dictionaries, which MUST have the following keys:</t>
<t>
<list style="numbers">

</list>
</t>
<t>Each key MUST NOT be used in any algorithms other than the one prescribed on the key <spanx style="verb">usage</spanx>.</t>
<t>Key material MUST NOT be reused.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="subject-attributes" title="Subject Attributes">
<t>Attributes in the singular are a single value and attributes in the plural are arrays.</t>
<t>The CA MUST verify the attributes it will use on certificates it issues. If any verification is not done or fails, the corresponding attributes MUST NOT be included in the issued certificate. Examples:</t>
<t>
<list style="numbers">
<t>If the CA fails to verify that a phone number really belongs to the subject, it MUST never be included.</t>
<t>If the subject of the certificate to be issued forgets to bring their USA/SSN, this attribute MUST NOT be included in the certificate.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>A CA MAY refuse to issue a certificate if essential properties could not verified. Examples: INT/name, USA/SSN, BRA/RG, BRA/CPF.</t>

<section anchor="id" title="id">
<t>A string pointing to an attribute which no other entity shares that value. Examples: <spanx style="verb">BRA/CPF</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">USA/SSN</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">INT/passports:number</spanx>.</t>
<t>This is, two entities are the same when their respective ids (attribute name and value) match. The reverse is not guaranteed.</t>
<t>The syntax is <spanx style="verb">&lt;key&gt;</spanx> or <spanx style="verb">&lt;key&gt;:&lt;sub-key&gt;</spanx>. If there is an array, the first value is always used as if it were the only one.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="int-type" title="INT/type">
<t>An enum describing the type of the subject. Possible values are: <spanx style="verb">natural person</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">legal person</spanx>, and <spanx style="verb">other</spanx> (ex: software).</t>
</section>

<section anchor="int-names" title="INT/names">
<t>Each name is a one line Unicode string.</t>
<t>Each name entry SHOULD be at most 5 KiB long.</t>
<t>All apps MUST support such long names. They MAY, however, show only the beginning of the name by default and have a simple way to show the full name. Example: a tooltip or a button close to the name.</t>
<t>There MUST be at least one name in the <spanx style="verb">INT/names</spanx> attribute.</t>
<t>Any prefixes, suffixes, infixes, honorifics and similar things attached to the name MUST be verified. Example: a person may never use the prefix &quot;Dr.&quot; if they have no valid doctorates degree.</t>
<t>Generic prefixes like &quot;Mr.&quot; or &quot;Ms.&quot; and job titles MUST NOT be included in any of the names.</t>
<t>For legal persons, it is RECOMMENDED to follow the convention: <spanx style="verb">(&lt;Acronym&gt;) &lt;Full Legal Name&gt; &lt;Any special endings&gt;</spanx> Examples:</t>
<t>
<list style="numbers">
<t>(USP) Universidade São Paulo</t>
<t>Monsters Inc.</t>
<t>Empresa Qualquer Serviços e Comércio LTDA</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>For natural persons, it is RECOMMENDED to follow the convention: <spanx style="verb">(&lt;Nick Name&gt;) &lt;First Name&gt; &lt;Full Middle Name&gt; &lt;Last Name&gt;</spanx> Examples:</t>

<section anchor="int-parents" title="INT/parents">
<t>An array of entities. The order MUST NOT be assigned any meaning. The array MAY have any number of elements.</t>
<t>The <spanx style="verb">INT/parents</spanx> attribute MAY lead to a recursive behaviour. This attribute SHOULD NOT exceed the grandparents generations.</t>
<t>Example:</t>

]
</artwork></figure>
</section>

<section anchor="int-guardians" title="INT/guardians">
<t>Pretty much the same as the <spanx style="verb">INT/parents</spanx> attribute.</t>
<t>It it is present, the entities <spanx style="verb">INT/parents</spanx> MUST NOT be considered as legal guardians.</t>
<t>It is absent, the entities <spanx style="verb">INT/parents</spanx> MAY be assumed to be legal guardians.</t>
<t>Example:</t>

</section>

<section anchor="int-emails" title="INT/emails">
<t>An array of the subject's email addresses.</t>
<t>The fist entry is considered the main one.</t>
<t>The subject MAY have no email address.</t>
<t>It is RECOMMENDED to have at least one ASCII-only email address.</t>
<t>Examples:</t>

</artwork></figure>
</section>

<section anchor="int-phones" title="INT/phones">
<t>For SPAM/robo-calling prevention the subject MUST have the right to refuse the inclusion of the <spanx style="verb">INT/phone</spanx> attribute.</t>
<t>The phone numbers MUST be encoded as a string array. Each element of that array represents one phone number and MUST include the country and area codes.</t>
<t>The country code part MUST begin with a <spanx style="verb">+</spanx> (plus sign) and have a space to separate it from the rest of the number. This is mainly to aid humans, by separating the international part from the local one.</t>
<t>The rest of the number SHOULD follow the traditions and conventions of the country in question and MAY include punctuation.</t>
<t>Examples:</t>

<figure><artwork type="js">// Okay:
[]
[&quot;+55 (11) 0 0000-0000&quot;, &quot;+55 0800 000&quot;]
// Wrong:

</artwork></figure>
<t>Note: This attribute is intended to be used by some legal persons and by pretty much no natural persons.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="int-addresses" title="INT/addresses">
<t>For security reasons the subject MUST have the right to refuse the inclusion of <spanx style="verb">INT/address</spanx> attribute.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="int-pictures" title="INT/pictures">
<t>For privacy reasons the subject SHOULD have the right to refuse the inclusion of <spanx style="verb">INT/pictures</spanx> attribute. The CA, however, CAN require this attribute but its is encouraged not to require it.</t>
<t>The picture MUST always be static: no animated GIFs or similar.</t>
<t>For natural persons the image MUST be picture of the subject. The specific are left to the CA, but it SHOULD follow the traditions and conventions of the CA's country.</t>
<t>One suggestion for CAs is to follow the ICAO guidelines on photos for passports (see <xref target="ICAO-9303"></xref>).</t>
<t>For legal persons the image MUST be a logo or other symbol that represents the subject. It MUST NOT be a picture of the owners or of the place where the subject is. Again, specific are left to the CA.</t>
<t>Support for this property in apps is OPTIONAL but RECOMMENDED to those that have a GUI.</t>
<t>Those that decide to implement this property MUST be able do decode both JPEG and PNG.</t>
<t>The picture MUST be data URL encoded using base64 and MUST NOT exceed 1 MiB. The size restriction applies to the image itself, not to the string that encodes it.</t>
<t>The picture MUST NOT be rotated using metadata (see <xref target="JPEG-HOFF"></xref>) regardless of the file type (JPGE or PNG or other).</t>
<t>Example: (Tux, the Linux mascot)</t>

<section anchor="nameless-certificates" title="Nameless Certificates">
<t>👉 Open Question: It is feature a good idea?</t>
<t>Nameless certificates are self signed certificates meant for the end user. They are intended to serve as a way for people to start using and testing JUDSYS-1 without the need to pay the CAs.</t>
<t>All nameless certificates MUST have, on both <spanx style="verb">subject</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">issuer</spanx>, the <spanx style="verb">INT/name</spanx> attribute with a single element <spanx style="verb">Nameless Certificate</spanx>. There MUST NOT be any other names nor any other attributes.</t>
<t>The choice to prohibit names is intentional, as it ensures that no implementation will be able to display an unverified name, thus forcing the user to keep an &quot;address book&quot; to associate each person to their certificate.</t>
