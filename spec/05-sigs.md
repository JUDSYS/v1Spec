# Signatures

## Standard attributes

All signature attributes MUST NOT be arrays.

The `INT/date` and `INT/reason` attributes are MANDATORY. All others are OPTIONAL, but each country MAY require certain attributes.

### INT/reason

A dictionary that indicates why the signer is signing this document. Possible keys:

1. `sent`: The signer sent the document.
2. `created`: The signer created the document.
3. `approved`: The signer approved the document.
4. `rejected`: The signer rejected the document.
4. `delivered`: The signer placed the document where the recipient is expected to look regularly. Example: A server placed an email on the recipient's account.
5. `received`: The signer received the document. Example: a person counter-signs with this key to confirm they received an email.

All undefined values MUST be interpreted as false.

Apps MUST NOT add their own keys. 

Both the `approved` and `rejected` keys MAY be true at the same time. When this happens, it means that the signer approved a part of the document and rejected another. 

### INT/location

A dictionary with the following keys:

1. `country`: A string with the country code.
2. `zip`: A string with the place's ZIP code equivalent according to the the country.

Except for `country` which is MANDATORY, all other keys are OPTIONAL.
